                        <p>
                            We hope you can join us Saturday, October 24, 2015 in Chimayo, New Mexico for our wedding!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Chimayo is a historic village about 30 miles north of Santa Fe or roughly 90 miles north of Albuquerque. We anticipate most of our guests will fly into Albuquerque airport (ABQ) and stay in Santa Fe near the Plaza. <strong>For the wedding ceremony Saturday night, we will provide transportation to and from the Santa Fe Plaza.</strong> We will also host some celebratory events in Santa Fe on Friday, October 23 and Sunday, October 25.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Please bear with us as we continue to work on this site. In the meantime you can send any questions (or early RSVPs) to <strong>elihannahwedding (at) gmail</strong>.

                        <h4>Friday Welcome Reception</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We will host a welcome reception Friday evening in Santa Fe for those guests traveling from out of state.</li>
                            <li>Join us at the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/coyote-rooftop-cantina-santa-fe" target="_blank">Coyote Rooftop Cantina</a>, just off the Plaza, from 6 to 9 p.m.</li>
                            <li>Light food and drinks will be served. It won't be a sit-down dinner, but there should be enough to make a meal out of it.</li>
                            <li>Some contingent will likely venture out afterward for more Friday Night Fun in Santa Fe.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Saturday Wedding and Party</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Our wedding ceremony and party will be Saturday evening, October 24, at <a href="http://ranchodechimayo.com/index.htm" target="_blank">Rancho de Chimayo Restaurante</a>.</li>
                            <li>Cocktails and snacks will be served at 5:30, followed by a brief ceremony, a delicious traditional New Mexican meal, and general merriment.</li>
                            <li><strong>We will provide transportation to and from the Sante Fe Plaza for Saturday night's event.</strong> First shuttle leaves the Plaza at 4:45 p.m. Shuttles will return to the Santa Fe Plaza when the party's over.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Sunday Brunch</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Brunch will be served at the <a href="http://www.lafondasantafe.com/" target="_blank">La Fonda on the Plaza Hotel</a>, in the Santa Fe Room, from 10 a.m. to noon.</li>
                            <li>All are welcome, but please RSVP!</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            We expect that most of our guests will fly into the Albuquerque International Sunport (yes, that's what it's called -- it's also called ABQ). There is also an airport in Santa Fe (SAF), but connections tend to be limited and ticket prices high. We recommend fying into ABQ.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It should be possible to attend the entire wedding without renting a car. The <a href="http://www.sandiashuttle.com" target="_blank">Sandia Shuttle Express</a> runs hourly from ABQ to Santa Fe, and they'll drop you off pretty much anywhere. The shuttle costs $28 one-way and $48 round trip.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you want to drive yourself, Santa Fe is about an hour by car from Albuquerque, and Chimayo is about 40 minutes from Santa Fe.

Santa Fe is beautiful and historic, with many lovely places to stay.

                            There are loads of other great places to stay in Santa Fe, but we do recommend you stay within walking distance of the Plaza. <a href="http://www.hotels.com/search.do?resolved-location=LANDMARK%3A1500152%3APROVIDED%3APROVIDED&f-distance=10.0&f-lid=1644449&destination-id=1500152&q-destination=Santa%20Fe,%20New%20Mexico%2C%20United%20States%20of%20America&q-localised-check-in=10%2F23%2F15&q-localised-check-out=10%2F25%2F15&q-rooms=1&q-room-0-adults=2&q-room-0-children=0&sort-order=DISTANCE_FROM_LANDMARK" target="_blank">Hotels.com</a> lets you sort search results by proximity to the Plaza, and you might even be able to beat our group rate deals on the above hotels.

                        <h3>Staying Elsewhere</h3>
                        <p>
                            Chimayo and the surrounding area are beautiful, and there are a number of small inns and B&Bs where you might stay. A couple highly regarded options include <a href="http://casaescondida.com" target="_blank">Casa Escondida</a> and <a href="http://ranchomanzana.com" target="_blank">Rancho Manzana</a>. (The Inn at Rancho de Chimayo, across the street from the wedding venue, has already been booked through the weekend by the Davey and Leland families).

                        <p>
                            Please note that if you choose not to stay in Santa Fe, <strong>you will be responsible for your own transportation throughout the weekend</strong>.

                            There are many wonderful things to do in and around Santa Fe. We'll update this section soon with more details, but for now here are a few highlights:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Georgia O'Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe</li>
                            <li>The New Mexico Museum of Art</li>
                            <li>The Galleries on Canyon Road in Santa Fe</li>
                            <li>Shopping for Indian jewelery on the Santa Fe Plaza</li>
                            <li>Ten Thousand Waves, a Japanese-style spa and resort just outside Santa Fe. It's wonderful!</li>
                            <li>Ojo Caliente, a natural hot springs spa and resort about 45 minutes north of Chimayo</li>
                            <li>Bandelier National Monument, famed for the cliff dwellings and other historic homes of the Ancestral Pueblo People, about an hour from Santa Fe</li>
                            <li>The 1000-year-old Taos Pueblo, one of the oldest continuously inhabited communities in the United States, about 90 minutes north of Santa Fe. Hannah and I visited on our last trip and were absolutely blown away. If you visit, be sure to take the guided tour.</li>
