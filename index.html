                        <h4>Friday evening in Santa Fe, temps in the 40s, chance of rain</h4>
                        <p>
                            Friday evening's event at the Coyote Rooftop Cantina is a partially outdoor venue. There's a roof over most of it, outdoor heaters, and drop shades to protect us from the rain. All the same we suggest you dress for cool weather, with shoes to match (no open toes!).
                        </p>
                        <h4>Saturday ceremony in Chimayo</h4>
                        <p>
                            Welcome cocktails and our ceremony will be outdoors. Weather is looking clear at this point, but expect temperatures in the 50s. The rest of the evening's proceedings will be indoors.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Welcome</h2>
                        <p>
                            We hope you can join us Saturday, October 24, 2015 in Chimayo, New Mexico for our wedding!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Chimayo is a historic village about 30 miles north of Santa Fe or roughly 90 miles north of Albuquerque. We anticipate most of our guests will fly into Albuquerque airport (ABQ) and stay in Santa Fe near the Plaza. <strong>For the wedding ceremony Saturday night, we will provide transportation to and from the Santa Fe Plaza.</strong> We will also host some celebratory events in Santa Fe on Friday, October 23 and Sunday, October 25.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Please bear with us as we continue to work on this site. In the meantime you can send any questions (or early RSVPs) to <strong>elihannahwedding (at) gmail</strong>.

                        <ul>
                            <li>We will host a welcome reception Friday evening in Santa Fe.</li>
                            <li>Join us at the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/coyote-rooftop-cantina-santa-fe" target="_blank">Coyote Rooftop Cantina </a>(<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/gEgDL1mHtc32" target="_blank">map link</a>), just off the Plaza, from 6 to 9 pm.</li>
                            <li>Light food and drinks will be served. It won't be a sit-down dinner, but there should be enough to make a meal out of it.</li>
                            <li>We have the Cantina all night, and will break out the karaoke machine following the reception. Hope you can stay for it!</li>
                            <li>Attire is casual. The Cantina occupies a covered but unenclosed terrace, and temperatures will be in the 50s. The venue has heaters but <strong>we suggest bringing an extra layer to keep warm.</strong></li>

                            <li>Shuttles depart from the green loading zone on East San Francisco Street, between the east entrance of La Fonda on the Plaza Hotel and the parking garage entrance.</li>

                        <p>
                            We expect that most of our guests will fly into the Albuquerque International Sunport (yes, that's what it's called -- it's also called ABQ). There is also an airport in Santa Fe (SAF), but connections tend to be limited and ticket prices high. We recommend fying into ABQ.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It should be possible to attend the entire wedding without renting a car. The <a href="http://www.sandiashuttle.com" target="_blank">Sandia Shuttle Express</a> runs hourly from ABQ to Santa Fe, and they'll drop you off pretty much anywhere. The shuttle costs $28 one-way and $48 round trip.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you want to drive yourself, Santa Fe is about an hour by car from Albuquerque, and Chimayo is about 40 minutes from Santa Fe.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Uber is now operating in Santa Fe, for those of you who wish to take advantage of the new "sharing economy" for your transportation needs.

                            We imagine that most of our guests will want to stay in Santa Fe, near the Plaza.

Santa Fe is beautiful and historic, with many lovely places to stay.

                            Chimayo and the surrounding area are beautiful, and there are a number of small inns and B&Bs where you might stay. A couple highly regarded options include <a href="http://casaescondida.com" target="_blank">Casa Escondida</a> and <a href="http://ranchomanzana.com" target="_blank">Rancho Manzana</a>. (The Inn at Rancho de Chimayo, across the street from the wedding venue, has already been booked through the weekend by the Davey and Leland families).
