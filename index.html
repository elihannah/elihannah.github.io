                    <h2>Welcome</h2>
                    <p>
                        We hope you can join us Saturday, October 24, 2015 in Chimayo, New Mexico for our wedding!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Chimayo is an historic New Mexican village, about 30 miles north of Santa Fe, and roughly 90 miles north of Albuquerque. We anticipate most of our guests will fly into Albuquerque airport (ABQ) and stay in Santa Fe near the plaza. <strong>For the wedding ceremony Saturday night, we will provide transportation to and from the Santa Fe Plaza.</strong> We will also host some celebratory events in Santa Fe on Friday, October 23 and Sunday, October 25.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please bear with us as we continue to work on our wedding website. In the meantime you can send any questions (or early RSVPs) to <strong>elihannahwedding (at) gmail</strong>.

                    <h4>Friday Welcome Reception</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We will host a welcome reception Friday evening in Santa Fe. All are invited!</li>
                        <li>Light food and drinks will be served. It won't be a sit-down dinner, but there should be enough to make a meal out of it.</li>
                        <li>Precise location and time TBD, but it will be somewhere within walking distance to the Santa Fe plaza, from 6-9 p.m. or so. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Saturday Wedding and Party</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Our wedding ceremony and party will be Saturday evening, October 24, at <a href="http://ranchodechimayo.com/index.htm">Rancho de Chimayo Restaurante</a>.</li>
                        <li>Cocktails and snacks will be served at 5:30, followed by a brief ceremony, a delicious traditional New Mexican meal, and general merriment.</li>
                        <li><strong>We will provide transportation to and from the Sante Fe plaza for Saturday night's event.</strong> First shuttle leaves the plaza at 4:45 p.m. Shuttles will return to the Santa Fe plaza when the party's over.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Sunday Brunch</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Brunch will be served at the <a href="http://www.lafondasantafe.com/">La Fonda on the Plaza Hotel</a>, in the Santa Fe Room, from 10 a.m. to noon.</li>
                        <li>All are welcome, but please RSVP!</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Travel</h2>
                    <p>
                        We expect that most of our guests will fly into the Albuquerque International Sunport (yes, that's what it's called -- it's also called ABQ). There is also an airport in Santa Fe (SAF), but connections tend to be limited and ticket prices high. We recommend fying into ABQ.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It should be possible to attend the entire wedding without renting a car. The <a href="http://www.sandiashuttle.com">Sandia Shuttle Express</a> runs hourly from ABQ to Santa Fe, and they'll drop you off pretty much anywhere. The shuttle costs $28 one-way and $48 round trip.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you want to drive yourself, Santa Fe is about an hour by car from Albuquerque, and Chimayo is about 40 minutes from Santa Fe.

                    <h2>Accommodations</h2>
                    <p>
                        We imagine that most of our guests will want to stay in Santa Fe, near the plaza. Friday's and Sunday's events will take place nearby, and we will provide shuttle transportation to and from Chimayo on Saturday evening. Santa Fe is beautiful and historic, with many lovely places to stay. We have reserved room blocks for our guests at the following hotels, for Friday, October 23 and Saturday, October 24:
